# Valorant Analysis

## Description
This is a Valorant Data Analysis website made with Java, Plotly, and NetworkX, designed to help maximize the chances of winning
a game in Valorant. The program utilizes real-world datasets from the Valorant Champion Tour 2021-2023 data on Kaggle. The data is cleaned and computed
to display in an interactive weighed graph and two trees to visualize the relationship between agents and maps, what type of buy, and whether they won 
more as attacker or defender.
